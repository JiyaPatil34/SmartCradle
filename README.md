# Smart Cradle

**2nd Sem | (Feb ’24 – June ’24)**

## Project Overview
Built a smart cradle as part of a team of 4 in the Engineering Exploration course. The prototype is designed to initiate swinging when the baby starts crying and continue for a duration of 5 minutes.

## Technologies Used
- AGILE Methodology
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Actuators
- Rack and Pinion mechanism

## Key Features & Outcomes
- **Automated Swinging**: The cradle automatically starts swinging when the baby cries.
- **Duration Control**: The swinging continues for a set duration of 5 minutes.
- **Prototyping Excellence**: The project showcases innovative use of Arduino Mega 2560 and Actuators for automation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Mobile App**: Allow parents to control and monitor the cradle via a mobile app.
- **Enhanced Sensory Detection**: Improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the crying detection mechanism.
- **Safety Features**: Adding safety features such as automatic stopping if an obstruction is detected.
